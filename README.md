A Password Storage &amp; Encryption Application

Developed for my Capstone Project at Denver University.  I wanted a secure password storage application that I could be sure properly encrypted all the data.

Though nothing fancy, it serves as a simple and secure way to store passwords (and other data).  It is self-contained and portable - meaning that to transfer/backup, you need only to copy the folder, as all the data is stored in files within the application.
